# Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree 


##PART 1
###Orientation

Welcome to the Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree program! In this section you'll get a sneak peak of the classroom, meet the team, and learn about the services provided. Then you'll take a readiness assessment and check out some learning resources to help you make the most out of your experience.
##PART 2
###Bayesian Thinking

Learn the framework that underlies a self-driving car’s understanding of itself and the world around it, and to see the world the way a self-driving car does.
Project: Joy Ride
##PART 3
###Working with Matrices

This course will focus on two tools which are vital to self-driving car engineers: object oriented programming and linear algebra.
Project: Implement a Matrix Class
##PART 4
###C++ Basics

This course is the first step in a rewarding journey towards C++ expertise. The goal is translation: get a program written in Python, and translate it into C++.
Project: Translate Python to C++
##PART 5
###Performance Programming in C++

Explore how to write good code that runs correctly. We’ll focus primarily on low level features of C++, but we’ll discuss other best practices as well.
##PART 6
###Navigating Data Structures

Algorithmic thinking is a skill you’ll refine throughout your career. In this course you’ll focus on frequently used data structures and algorithms.
Project: Implement Route Planner
##PART 7
###Visualizing Calculus and Controls

In this course you’ll learn basic calculus—the mathematics of continuity. You’ll also learn to use some of Python’s most popular visualization libraries.

##PART 8 
###Computer Vision and Machine Learning

In this course you’ll learn how a computer sees an image, and how we can use machine learning to teach a computer to identify images programmatically.
