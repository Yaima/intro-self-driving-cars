#Two Dimensional Histogram Filter - Your First Feature (and your first bug). 

Writing code is important. But a big part of being on a self driving car team is working with a large existing codebase. On high stakes engineering projects like a self driving car, you will probably have to earn the trust of your managers and coworkers before they'll let you make substantial changes to the code base.

A typical assignment for someone new to a team is to make progress on a backlog of bugs. So with that in mind, that's what you will be doing for your first project in the Nanodegree.

You'll go through this project in a few parts:

1. **Explore the Code** - don't worry about bugs at this point. The goal is to get a feel for how this code base is organized and what everything does.
2. **Implement a Feature** - write code that gets the robot moving correctly.
3. **Fix a Bug** - Implementing motion will reveal a bug which hadn't shown up before. Here you'll identify what the bug is and take steps to reproduce it. Then you'll identify the cause and fix it.
